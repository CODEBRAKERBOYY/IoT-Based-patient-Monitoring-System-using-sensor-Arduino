# IoT-Based-patient-Monitoring-System-using-sensor-Arduino

Problem Statement:
Patients who are unable to communicate or are bedridden face challenges in signaling discomfort or emergencies, leading to delayed medical response and increased risk. A reliable and cost-effective real-time health monitoring solution is necessary to track vital signs, detect emergencies like falls or abnormal conditions, and notify caregivers instantly, especially for home-bound or elderly patients.
 
Proposed Solution:
We propose an IoT-based real-time health monitoring system designed for patients requiring constant health monitoring. The system uses Arduino Mega2560, along with multiple sensors such as MAX30100 for heart rate and SpO2. The GPRS module (SIM800L) enables data transmission and emergency alerts via SMS to caregivers. An emergency push button or flex sensor allows the patient to trigger alerts when in distress. This ensures immediate attention, even in low-connectivity environments.
