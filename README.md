# 🏥 IoT Based Health Monitoring System

A smart and real-time IoT solution designed to continuously measure and monitor vital human health parameters.  
This system collects Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Body Temperature data using biomedical sensors and transmits it to a cloud server for remote monitoring and anomaly detection.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **IoT Based Health Monitoring System** enables 24×7 health observation without requiring the patient to be physically present in hospitals.  
Live sensor readings are uploaded to a cloud database and visualized on a dashboard, allowing doctors/caregivers to monitor patient status remotely.  
Whenever a health-related abnormality occurs, the system can trigger alerts for early intervention.

## 🎯 Key Features
- Real-time monitoring of **Heart Rate, Blood Pressure & Body Temperature**
- Wireless transmission of sensor data via **ESP8266 / ESP32 Wi-Fi module**
- **Cloud database integration** for storing health records
- **Interactive dashboard** to display health values graphically
- **Threshold-based anomaly alerts** for abnormal readings
- **Low-cost, scalable & portable design**
- Can be used for **home healthcare, elderly care & emergency assistance**

## 🚨 Anomaly Detection
Alerts are generated when:
- Heart Rate > 120 BPM or < 60 BPM  
- Body Temperature > 38°C or < 36°C  
- BP values beyond normal threshold
